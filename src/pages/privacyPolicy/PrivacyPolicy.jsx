                  <p>
                    Information automatically collected. In Short: Some
                    information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address
                    and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected
                    automatically when you visit our Website.
                    <br />
                    We automatically collect certain information when you visit,
                    use or navigate the Website. This information does not
                    reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact
                    information) but may include device and usage information,
                    such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
                    operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
                    device name, country, location, information about how and
                    when you use our Website and other technical information.
                    This information is primarily needed to maintain the
                    security and operation of our Website, and for our internal
                    analytics and reporting purposes. <br />
                    Like many businesses, we also collect information through
                    cookies and similar technologies. <br />
                    The information we collect includes: <br />
                    Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
                    diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers
                    automatically collect when you access or use our Website and
                    which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact
                    with us, this log data may include your IP address, device
                    information, browser type and settings and information about
                    your activity in the Website (such as the date/time stamps
                    associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches
                    and other actions you take such as which features you use),
                    device event information (such as system activity, error
                    reports (sometimes called ‘crash dumps’) and hardware
                    settings). <br />
                    Device Data. We collect device data such as information
                    about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use
                    to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this
                    device data may include information such as your IP address
                    (or proxy server), device and application identification
                    numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet
                    service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and
                    system configuration information. <br />
                    Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                    about your device’s location, which can be either precise or
                    imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the
                    type and settings of the device you use to access the
                    Website. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies
                    to collect geolocation data that tells us your current
                    location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
                    allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
                    access to the information or by disabling your Location
                    setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt
                    out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
                    Services.
