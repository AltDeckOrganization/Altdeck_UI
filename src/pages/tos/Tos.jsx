                <p>
                  COINMOONER SHALL IN NO EVENT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU
                  OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT
                  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT,
                  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, LIQUIDATED OR
                  PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFIT,
                  REVENUE OR BUSINESS, ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM YOUR
                  ACCESS TO FINANCIALPLANNER, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR THIS
                  AGREEMENT, EVEN IF COINMOONER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br />
                  Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
                  liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
                  provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of
                  the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by
                  You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven’t purchased
                  anything through the Service. <br />
                  <br />
                  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
                  shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
                  incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
                  (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
                  loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
                  for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any
                  way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
                  third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the
                  Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this
                  Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised
                  of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
                  fails of its essential purpose.
                  <br />
                  Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties
                  or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential
                  damages, which means that some of the above limitations may
                  not apply. In these states, each party’s liability will be
                  limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

                  Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
                  its and their respective licensors and service providers,
                  expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,

                  all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a

                  that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
                  performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to
                  the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
                  undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the
                  Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
                  results, be compatible or work with any other software,
                  applications, systems or services, operate without
                  interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or
                  be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
                  corrected.
                  <br />
                  Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
                  the company’s provider makes any representation or warranty of
                  any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
                  availability of the Service, or the information, content, and
                  materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service
                  will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,
                  reliability, or currency of any information or content
                  provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its
                  servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the
                  Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,

                  <br />
                  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types
                  of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of
                  a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
                  limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the
                  exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be
                  applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable
                  law.
